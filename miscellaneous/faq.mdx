## Payments

### Q9: What types of payments can I accept with Dodo Payments?

A: Dodo Payments supports a variety of payment methods, including **credit cards**, **debit cards**, and **digital wallets**. We also support one-time payments and recurring subscription payments for digital products.

### Q10: How can I track payment statuses?

A: You can track the status of payments from the **Payments** section of your dashboard. Each transaction is listed with a status indicator: **In Progress**, **Failed**, or **Successful**.

### Q11: What should I do if a payment fails?

A: If a payment fails, check the **Payment Details Page** for more information. Common reasons include incorrect payment details, insufficient funds, or network issues. You can resend the payment link to your customer to retry the payment.

### Q12: Does the chargeback apply for business even if my business has a “No refund” policy?
    
Yes. Even if you state “No refunds” in your terms or website, chargebacks are largely governed by the cardholder’s bank and card network rules (e.g., Visa, Mastercard). A “No refund” policy does not override the card network’s dispute resolution process. If a customer files a dispute, your business is still subject to a chargeback investigation. This means you must respond with evidence (proof of delivery, usage logs, terms acceptance, etc.) to fight or manage the dispute. If the customer’s bank decides in favor of the cardholder, the chargeback fee and transaction reversal will apply regardless of your stated policy. We recommend having clear communications, tracking customer usage, and providing compelling evidence when chargebacks arise.
