## Verification, Tax & Compliance

<Accordion title="Q109: Why is my verification taking so long?">
  A: Dodo Payments typically takes 24–72 working hours to process verifications. However, delays can occur due to:
  - High volume of applications
  - Weekends and public holidays
  - Incomplete or incorrect submissions
  - Manual reviews for risk or compliance

  <Note>
  If it's been more than 72 hours, please check your email or Dodo Payments dashboard for any required action. You can also DM your registered email to the team on Discord for a follow-up.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q112: I submitted my W-8BEN form, but the signature section doesn't work properly. What do I do?">
  A: Use a proper PDF editor like:
  - Adobe Acrobat
  - Mac Preview (works for most)
  - Smallpdf or PDFescape (online editors)

  If there's a cross mark on the signature, make sure:
  - You're saving the file after applying the signature.
  - The tool is flattening the signature layer (some editors don't).

  <Tip>
  Avoid signing in browser previewers—they don't always embed digital signatures properly.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q113: I chose the wrong registration type (business vs individual). How can I fix it?">
  A: If you selected the wrong entity type (e.g., chose "Organization" but you're an individual with GST), your verification might be blocked or require forms like W-8BEN-E.

  To correct it:
  - Inform support via Intercom or Discord.
  - You may need to reapply with the correct type.

  <Note>
  Choosing the right entity type ensures your tax forms and verification steps are aligned.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q118: My verification was declined due to entity mismatch. What should I do?">
  A: This often happens when:
  - You selected "Organization" but operate as a sole proprietor.
  - You entered entity PAN but your registration is under an individual's name.

  Steps to fix:
  - Choose the correct entity type (individual vs organization).
  - Re-upload the right version of W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E.
  - Include the correct PAN/FTIN fields as per your status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q119: I reached $100 in earnings. Will my account get verified faster?">
  A: Yes. Once your earnings cross the payout threshold ($100), Dodo Payments prioritizes your verification.

  <Note>
  This does not guarantee instant approval — ensure your business model and documents are compliant.
  </Note>

  If you've crossed $100 and still see delays, reach out to our support.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q121: Can I use a different name (like my parent's) to sign up and get verified?">
  A: No. The person signing up must match the legal owner of the business and all submitted documents.

  If your parent is the actual business owner:
  - They should sign up using their email and mobile number.
  - All documents should be in their name.

  <Note>
  Using someone else's name for verification while you manage the business may lead to compliance rejection.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q122: How do I check the reason for verification rejection?">
  A: You can find the reason in:
  - The Dodo Payments dashboard, under the verification section.
  - Email notifications (if enabled)

  <Tip>
  If it's not visible, contact compliance@dodopayments.com or DM your registered email ID to a team member.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q124: Can I create a new business account if my previous one was declined?">
  A: Yes — but only if:
  - You've fixed the issues that led to rejection.
  - You're not attempting to bypass risk decisions (e.g., deboarding for fraud concerns).

  <Note>
  Creating multiple accounts without resolving the underlying issue will likely result in the new account being rejected as well.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q127: I've been told my account was previously deboarded. What does this mean?">
  A: If you see a message stating your account was previously deboarded by the risk team:
  - It means Dodo Payments found significant compliance or risk issues with your activity or business.
  - Attempting to create new accounts using the same identity or business details will likely be rejected again.

  <Note>
  If you believe this is a mistake, email compliance@dodopayments.com and request a review — include clear evidence to support your case.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q129: How do I get my payout verification cleared faster?">
  A: To avoid delays:
  - Submit clear, properly formatted documents
  - Avoid repeated messages/tags in Discord — this slows the queue
  - Mention if you've crossed the payout threshold or have urgent timelines
  - DM your registered email ID if asked

  <Tip>
  Most payout reviews are completed within 72 working hours, unless there's an issue with your submission.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="Q133: What if I chose the wrong form (W-8BEN vs W-8BEN-E)?">
  A: These forms are tied to your entity type:
  - W-8BEN is for Individuals
  - W-8BEN-E is for Organizations

  If you submitted the wrong one:
  - Contact support to reset your form.
  - Fill and upload the correct form type.
  - Ensure the PAN is in the correct field (Line 6a for individuals).

  <Tip>
  Refer to IRS official form guides if confused.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q134: I have a GST with a trade name. Is that considered an organization?">
  A: No. If you're registered with a GST as an individual (sole proprietor), you're still considered an Individual.

  ✅ Use W-8BEN
  ✅ Select "Individual" in the registration
  ❌ Do not fill W-8BEN-E or select "Organization" unless you're a registered legal entity
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q139: My account was deboarded. Can I just create a new one?">
  A: Creating a new account to bypass a previous deboarding is not allowed. If you attempt this:
  - The new account may also be flagged or rejected
  - Risk decisions carry over across signups if the underlying business or person is the same

  <Tip>
  If you believe you were wrongly deboarded, email compliance@dodopayments.com with your case.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q24: How does Dodo Payments handle GST for Indian SaaS merchants?">
  A: Dodo Payments automatically calculates and applies **GST** for Indian merchants based on your customer's location.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q25: Does Dodo Payments handle international sales?">
  A: Yes, Dodo Payments supports international sales and manages all associated compliances.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q26: Are address data such as city, state, zipcode fields mandatory? Can I exclude requesting those values from my customer?">
  A: Yes they are mandatory as we are the Merchant of Record and generate invoices, file taxes and ensure all purchases are compliant we require the Merchant's billing address. You can implement our API based checkout flow where you can pre-fill the customer's details if you have already collected them to ensure a smoother experience for your customers but we will need these details for every purchase.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q81: Do I need to file taxes in the US if I sell there?">
  A: Not directly. Dodo Payments acts as the Merchant of Record, handles customer-side tax, and remits where applicable. You still need to:
  - File income tax in your home country (e.g., India)
  - Submit W-8BEN(-E) to avoid default 30% US withholding

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q82: I don't know whether to fill W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E — help?">
  A: Use the following logic:

  | You are... | Form to Submit | Merchant Type |
  |------------|----------------|---------------|
  | Sole Proprietor, Freelancer | W-8BEN | Individual |
  | Pvt Ltd, LLP, Registered Org | W-8BEN-E | Organization |

  Still unsure?
  - If your bank account is under your name, you're likely an individual.
  - If it's under a company, you're an organization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q83: What if I submitted the wrong tax form?">
  A: Don't worry — our compliance team will:
  - Review your form
  - Leave feedback on the portal if corrections are needed
  - Allow you to re-upload the right form

  You can also ask for review in the Discord compliance thread.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q84: Do I need a PAN or GST to receive payments?">
  A: Not necessarily:
  - PAN is strongly recommended (for KYC and tax purposes)
  - GST is optional unless you exceed the registration threshold or want input credit
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q41: Should I submit W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E?">
  A: Use the form based on your merchant type:
  - **Individual/Sole Proprietor**: W-8BEN
  - **Private Limited or LLP**: W-8BEN-E

  If you have a Udyam/MSME certificate but operate with a personal bank account, you're still considered an Individual.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q42: If Dodo handles taxes, why do I need to file W-8BEN(-E)?">
  A: Dodo handles sales tax for your customers. W-8BEN(-E) is needed for withholding tax on payouts to you.

  <Note>
  Filing W-8BEN correctly can help you avoid double taxation under India–US tax treaties.
  </Note>
</Accordion>



## Payments & Transactions

<Accordion title="Q9: What types of payments can I accept with Dodo Payments?">
  A: Dodo Payments supports a variety of payment methods, including **credit cards**, **debit cards**, and **digital wallets**. We also support one-time payments and recurring subscription payments for digital products.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q10: How can I track payment statuses?">
  A: You can track the status of payments from the **Payments** section of your dashboard. Each transaction is listed with a status indicator: **In Progress**, **Failed**, or **Successful**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q11: What should I do if a payment fails?">
  A: If a payment fails, check the **Payment Details Page** for more information. Common reasons include incorrect payment details, insufficient funds, or network issues. You can resend the payment link to your customer to retry the payment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q12: Does the chargeback apply for business even if my business has a no refund policy?">
  Yes. Even if you state No refunds in your terms or website, chargebacks are largely governed by the cardholder's bank and card network rules (e.g., Visa, Mastercard). A No refund policy does not override the card network's dispute resolution process. If a customer files a dispute, your business is still subject to a chargeback investigation. This means you must respond with evidence (proof of delivery, usage logs, terms acceptance, etc.) to fight or manage the dispute. If the customer's bank decides in favor of the cardholder, the chargeback fee and transaction reversal will apply regardless of your stated policy. We recommend having clear communications, tracking customer usage, and providing compelling evidence when chargebacks arise.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q58: Why is payment.status sometimes null?">
  A: payment.status can be null for a short time:
  - Right after creation but before processing completes
  - During subscription billing failures or retries

  Eventually, it becomes one of: succeeded, failed, or cancelled.

  <Note>
  Use webhook events like payment.succeeded or payment.failed for more reliable status tracking.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q59: Why is product_cart null even though it's a checkout?">
  A: 
  - For subscription payments, product_cart is empty because there's no one-time item being bought
  - product_cart is only populated for one-time payments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q91: Why was my real card blocked during testing?">
  A: You likely tested in Live Mode instead of Test Mode.

  Live payments:
  - Use real money
  - Go through real banks
  - May be flagged as suspicious if volume is low or inconsistent

  ✅ Always test using:
  - Test Mode in the dashboard
  - Test card numbers provided in the documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q99: My customer completed payment but I didn't receive webhook?">
  A: Checklist:
  - Confirm webhook is configured in Dashboard > Developers -> Webhooks
  - Check if webhook is failing silently due to non-2xx response
  - Check logs: was a 429 or timeout returned?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q100: Why is my dashboard showing success, but my app didn't update?">
  A: It's likely you're relying solely on redirect_url query params and not handling:
  - Webhooks
  - API confirmation call

  ✅ Fix:
  - Always listen for payment.succeeded webhook
  - Or query the API to confirm transaction after redirect
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q39: I'm not seeing UPI as a payment option — why?">
  A: This can happen for several reasons:
  - The billing country wasn't set to IN
  - UPI was not enabled for your business

  If you're a Non Indian Merchant, UPI won't appear for your customers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q40: Does Dodo support UPI for subscriptions?">
  A: Not currently. UPI is supported for one-time payments, but subscriptions rely on card mandates — UPI mandates are still in progress.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q57: How do I collect billing details without passing them in API?">
  A: If you want users to enter billing info themselves:
  - Use static links, which automatically collect billing
  - For dynamic flows, you must collect info manually and pass it in the API

  There's no built-in UI yet for collecting billing during dynamic link creation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q34: What's the difference between static and dynamic payment links?">
  A: **Static payment links** are no-code options meant for quick use. They:
  - Are configured from the dashboard
  - Automatically collect billing info
  - Cannot be customized per customer/session

  **Dynamic payment links** are created via API. They:
  - Require you to pass billing info explicitly
  - Can be customized in real-time (price, user ID, redirect URL, etc.)

  <Tip>
  If you don't want to write code, go with static links. If you need flexibility or want to build custom workflows, use dynamic links.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q35: Will I get two webhook events when someone starts a subscription?">
  A: On the first successful subscription payment, you will typically receive these three webhook if no trial period is involved:
  - `subscription.created` webhook
  - `payment.succeeded` webhook
  - `subscription.renewal` webhook
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q54: What does subscription.cancelled_at mean? Is it a scheduled cancellation?">
  A: Dodo supports both immediate and scheduled cancellations.

  When a cancellation request is made:
  - **Immediate cancellation**: The subscription.cancelled_at timestamp is set immediately and the subscription ends at that moment
  - **Scheduled cancellation**: Use the `cancel_at_next_billing_date` parameter in the subscription patch API to cancel at the end of the current billing period

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q76: When does a subscription get charged?">
  A: Dodo Payments charges the customer immediately upon subscription creation if the product does not have a trial period.

  <Note>
  For Indian cards and if there is a free trial is configured for the product, the payment will take 24 hours to process after the trial ends. This is due to RBI regulation.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


## Payouts & Bank Integration

<Accordion title="Q15: How do payouts work with Dodo Payments?">
  A: Payouts are the transfer of your collected sales revenue to your linked bank account. Payouts are processed by the 15th of every month for previous month's billing cycle barring any special circumstances like bank holidays or emergencies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q16: How do I link my bank account to receive payouts?">
  A: To link your bank account, navigate to the **Payout Settings** section of your dashboard and click **Add Bank Account**. You'll need to enter your bank details and verify the account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q17: Can I track the status of my payouts?">
  A: Yes, you can track your payout status from the **Payouts** section of the dashboard.&#x20;
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q18: What are payout fees and how much are they?">
  A: Payout fees refer to the transaction costs for transferring the money we've collected from your customers to your bank account. We constantly make improvements to reduce the payout fee by partnering with local partners in your country. Please refer to the [pricing and fee structure](/miscellaneous/pricing-and-fee-structure#2-payout-fees) for detailed information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q60: I received a &quot;payout processed&quot; email — when will the funds arrive?">
  A: Payouts usually take 1–2 business days to reflect in your bank account.

  <Note>
  Transfers don't settle on weekends or bank holidays. If your payout was processed on Friday, expect it by Monday or Tuesday.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q61: How do I add Payoneer as a payout account?">
  A: Just enter your Payoneer bank details in the Bank Info Form under your dashboard. There's no separate Payoneer integration yet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q101: Can I receive payouts to a Payoneer account?">
  A: Yes. You can receive payouts via Payoneer by:
  - Entering your Payoneer account details in the Bank Info Form on the Dodo dashboard
  - Ensure your account is approved and supports USD or the currency you're withdrawing

  There is no dedicated Payoneer integration — it is treated as a regular bank account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q102: My bank info and compliance form are still in review — what should I do?">
  A: Just wait. Our compliance team typically reviews forms within 1–2 working days. If it's urgent:
  - mail to support@dodopayments.com
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q115: What happens if my payout day falls on a Friday or weekend?">
  A: If your payout day is on a Friday, it is usually processed on the same day. However:
  - If there's a bank holiday or weekend, it may be delayed to the next working day (usually Monday).
  - The exact timing may depend on your bank's processing rules.

  <Note>
  If in doubt, check your dashboard or ask support with your registered email.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q117: How can I expedite payout compliance if I have an urgent launch or ad campaign planned?">
  A: If you've submitted everything and are awaiting payout compliance:
  - Mention your urgency clearly in support chats (e.g., live launch, paid campaigns).
  - Include your business ID and email.
  - Avoid spamming or tagging multiple team members — this may slow down the queue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q125: I submitted the wrong bank account details. How do I update them?">
  A: If you've entered incorrect bank details:
  - Contact support via Intercom or Discord or Mail.

  </Note>
</Accordion>

  </Note>
</Accordion>

  - Contact support and explain the situation.
  - Submit any official bank document confirming your account details and the absence of a SWIFT code.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q137: My country doesn't use SWIFT codes. Will this block my verification?">
  A: No, but you must:
  - Explain your situation to support
  - Provide bank documents that confirm your account number, holder name, and that no SWIFT is issued
  - Sometimes a generic placeholder SWIFT may be used (based on country)

  <Note>
  This case will go through manual compliance review. DM your email ID or write to compliance@dodopayments.com for escalation.
  </Note>
</Accordion>


## Invoicing & Reports

## Refunds & Disputes

<Accordion title="Q13: How do I issue a refund?">
  A: To issue a refund, go to the **Payment Details Page** of the transaction you want to refund and click the **Initiate Refund** button. You can issue a **full** or **partial** refund, provided the payment meets the refund eligibility rules.

  A: If a chargeback is filed against you:
  - You may lose both the transaction amount and a dispute fee
  - You can submit evidence of product delivery, usage logs, or customer communication
  - However, the final decision lies with the customer's issuing bank

  <Note>
  Email support@dodopayments.com with:
  - Dispute ID
  - Payment ID
  - Relevant proof
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q141: The customer disputed the charge after using the service. Can I appeal this?">
  A: Yes — you can:
  - Share documentation (chat logs, usage records, delivery confirmation)
  - Explain that the service was fulfilled
  - Request a waiver of the dispute fee if it's a first-time issue or if fraud is provable

  <Tip>
  There's no guarantee the fee will be waived, but ou team reviews each case on merit.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>


## Webhooks & Integration

<Accordion title="Q36: My webhook isn't receiving a POST request, only a GET. Why?">
  A: You're likely confusing the redirect URL with the webhook URL. A redirect URL is where the user is sent after a payment, and it may contain `?subscription_id=...&status=active` in a GET request. This is not your webhook.

  To receive structured POST payloads from Dodo Payments:
  - Set up a webhook under Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
  - Ensure the URL accepts POST requests and verifies the signature

  <Note>
  You can have both a webhook and a redirect URL — they serve different purposes.
  </Note>

<Accordion title="Q44: I get a 401 Unauthorized error using the Python SDK. Why?">
  A: You likely forgot to pass the correct environment when initializing the DodoPayments client.

  <Check>
  **Fix:**
  ```python
  client = DodoPayments(
      bearer_token="your_api_key",
      environment="live_mode"  # or "test_mode"
  )
  ```
  </Check>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q45: Is there a way to manually trigger a webhook event for testing?">
  A: You can do it through the webhook dashboard. Go to Dashboard -> Developers -> Webhooks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q46: What's the difference between webhook and redirect URL?">
  A: 
  - **Webhook URL**: Configured in dashboard. Receives POST payloads about events.
  - **Redirect URL**: Sent in the payment API request. Sends user back to your app with query params (`?status=success`).

  <Tip>
  Use webhooks to automate things like DB updates, and redirects to show thank-you screens.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q49: Why didn't I receive the product id in the payment.succeeded webhook for a subscription product?">
  A: The payment.succeeded webhook event for subscription products does not include a product_id. Instead, it provides the `subscription_id` associated with the subscription, along with other relevant details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q50: How do I verify the webhooks I receive are actually from dodo payments and not from any malicious actors?">
  A: To verify that the webhooks you receive are genuinely from Dodo Payments and not from malicious actors, follow these steps:
    1. **Check the Signature**: Each webhook sent by Dodo Payments includes a unique signature in the **`webhook-signature`** header. This signature is generated using your webhook's secret key and the payload of the event.
    2. **Retrieve the Secret Key**: Ensure you have the secret key for your webhook, which can be found in your Dodo Payments dashboard under the Webhooks settings.
    3. **Recompute the Signature**: Use the same signing algorithm (HMAC-SHA256) as Dodo Payments to compute the signature on your server. Use the payload of the webhook and your webhook secret key.
    4. **Compare Signatures**: Compare the recomputed signature with the one provided in the **`webhook-signature`** header. If they match, the webhook is authentic; if not, it should be rejected.
    5. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure your webhook endpoint uses HTTPS to secure communication and prevent tampering during data transmission.
  By implementing these steps, you can confidently verify the authenticity of webhooks sent by Dodo Payments. 

  <Tip>We recommend using packages provided by StandardWebhooks to verify signature and not construct it by yourself.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q51: Why am I receiving a subscription.renew webhook even for the first month payment?">
  A: For subscriptions, `subscription.renew` will be triggered whenever the subscription amount is deducted. So yes, this is expected behavior.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q52: How can I test webhooks locally?">
  A: To test webhooks locally, you can follow these steps:
  
1. **Use a Tunneling Tool**: Tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), [LocalTunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/), or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) can expose your local server to the internet. This provides a public URL that Dodo Payments can use to send webhook events to your local environment.
2. **Set Up the Webhook Endpoint**: Create a webhook endpoint in your local application to handle incoming webhook events. Ensure it listens for HTTP POST requests.
3. **Configure the Webhook in Dodo Payments**: Go to your Dodo Payments dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks settings, and update the webhook URL to the public URL generated by the tunneling tool.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q56: Why is my webhook not being called after payment?">
  A: Check the following:
  - You did not confuse the webhook URL with redirect URL
  - The webhook is configured under Developers > Webhooks
  - Your URL accepts POST requests and responds with 2xx
  - Signature validation (if enabled) is implemented correctly

  If you only see GETs with ?status=success, you are debugging the redirect URL, not the webhook.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q66: Is it safe to rely on status=success in URL query params?">
  A: No. While it's a quick win, URL query params can be tampered with.

  If you're using redirect_url?status=success:
  - Double-validate the transaction with an API call
  - Or wait for payment.succeeded webhook

  <Tip>
  Treat redirects as user-facing confirmations, not proof of payment.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>




## Testing & Local Development


<Accordion title="Q89: Can I test subscriptions in Test Mode?">
  A: Yes — subscriptions can be tested fully in Test Mode.

  Just don't use real card numbers.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q92: How do I switch between Test and Live Mode?">
  A: 
  - On your Dodo dashboard, look for a Test Mode toggle.
  - Switch it ON to use test API keys and simulate payments.

  You'll see "Test Mode" labels on all screens. Make sure to use the corresponding API key or environment when switching.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q93: Can I use real customer data in Test Mode?">
  A: Yes, but keep in mind:
  - No real money will be transferred
  - You can simulate webhooks and flows
  - Card details should still be test cards

  This helps debug flows end-to-end without any financial impact.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Q103: I'm getting: &quot;You must provide a mandate for off-session card payments&quot;">
  A: It means:
  - An Indian Card is used to make the payment but the billing country is not set as IN.
  - You likely passed an incorrect billing country.
