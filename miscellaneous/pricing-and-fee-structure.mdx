### **Chargeback Fees (In addition to chargeback amount)**

2. This is enabled by default and merchants cannot opt out of it.
3. **Fee for every Pre-Dispute alert is $30**. It is charged the moment we get an alert of an incoming chargeback. This is the fee charged by our partner which we pass on to the merchant.
4. Merchant gets a 24 hour window to review and fight the chargeback if they feel it is not fair.
5. If you decide to fight the chargeback, **an additional $30** fee will be charged for assisted chargeback resolution

Note : For INR Transactions only a chargeback fee of **Rs. 1000** per chargeback will be applied as there are no pre-dispute alerts in place
