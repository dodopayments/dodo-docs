At Dodo Payments, we take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that help us improve our platform. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us following the guidelines below.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## No Monetary Rewards (Bug Bounty Program)

Currently, **Dodo Payments does not have an official bug bounty program**. While we deeply appreciate security researchers' efforts, we **do not offer monetary rewards** for vulnerability disclosures. This ensures fairness for all individuals who have reported similar issues in the past.

## Recognition & Appreciation

We highly value the contributions of ethical security researchers. While we do not offer financial compensation, we would be happy to send **Dodo Payments goodies/merch** as a token of appreciation for valid security reports. If you are interested, please let us know after your report has been reviewed.

- **Do not publicly disclose** vulnerabilities until our team has had a reasonable time to address them.
- **Do not exploit** the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
