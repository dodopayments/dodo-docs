### Environment Dependency

**Environment Dependent:** All Environment Dependent features will have independent data in Test Mode and Live Mode. Any changes made in one environment will not affect the other. Eg. API Keys generated in Test Mode will be independent of API keys generated in Live Mode and vice versa

**Environment Independent:** All Environment Independent features will have the same data in both live mode and test mode. Eg. My Account section will have the same data in test mode and live mode. Changes made in one environment will affect the other environment

Live Mode will be available only post successful completion of Identity verification and Business Verification. You can accept real payments only in \`live mode\`.

API Hostnames for Test Mode and Live Mode are below:
- Test Mode: [`https://test.dodopayments.com`](https://test.dodopayments.com/)
- Live Mode: [`https://live.dodopayments.com`](https://live.dodopayments.com/)

## Key Highlights

1. All products created in test mode or live mode will only be available in the respective environment. There is an option of copy to live mode in the test mode environment. This will copy the product with all relevant details and create the same in live mode

2. API keys and Webhooks created in test mode will only be limited to test mode environment and will not affect live mode deployment and vice versa

3. All documents submitted for verification and Bank account details submitted will be the same in test mode and live mode. A change in this information in any environment will also change it in the other environment

## Test Card Details

Dodo Payments provides a set of Test Card numbers that you can use to simulate various payment scenarios. You can use these test card numbers to create simulated payments in test mode without processing actual payments or charges

Test card numbers are only valid in test mode. Don’t use them for real payments.
