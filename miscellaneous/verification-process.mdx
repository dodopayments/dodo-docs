This helps to ensure that your business is legitimate and adheres to legal requirements.

**Key Aspects of the Verification Process:**

* **Identity Verification**: The verification team confirms the authenticity of the personal identification documents provided during registration.

**Timeline**

The verification process is typically completed within **24 working hours**, unless additional documentation is required or further investigation is needed.

### **5. What to Do If Your Application is Rejected**

In some cases, a merchant’s application may be **rejected** if the verification team identifies unresolved issues or non-compliance with Dodo Payments’ policies. Common reasons for rejection include unsupported product categories, incomplete or unverifiable documentation, or failure to meet compliance standards.

**Steps to Take If Rejected:**

1. **Review the Rejection Reason**:
