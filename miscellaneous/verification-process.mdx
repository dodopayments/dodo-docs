**Key Aspects of the Verification Process:**

The verification process is typically completed within **24 working hours**, unless additional documentation is required or further investigation is needed.

### **4. What to Do If Your Application is Rejected**

In some cases, a merchant’s application may be **rejected** if the verification team identifies unresolved issues or non-compliance with Dodo Payments’ policies.
