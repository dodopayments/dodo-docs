## New Features ðŸš€

### Usage-Based Billing 
Bill customers precisely based on actual consumption. Define meters, ingest events, and convert usage into charges automatically.

- **Flexible aggregation**: count, sum (over property), unique, max, last
- **Event filtering**: AND/OR logic with rich comparators to include only relevant events
- **Product linkage**: attach meters to products with price-per-unit and optional free thresholds
- **Analytics**: track trends, event streams, and per-customer consumption
