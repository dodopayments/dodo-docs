- **New Subscription Event**: Added support for the `subscription.plan_changed` webhook event that fires whenever a subscription is upgraded, downgraded, or modified. This event provides:
  - Complete subscription details after the change
  - Previous and new plan information
  - Prorated billing adjustments
  - Updated next billing date

  This event complements our existing subscription events (`subscription.active`, `subscription.on_hold`, etc.) to provide comprehensive visibility into the subscription lifecycle.

- **Platform Enhancements**: Various performance optimizations, bug fixes, and minor improvements across the platform.
