## **1. Introduction**

At Dodo Payments, keeping your business and customer data safe is a top priority. We provide robust fraud prevention tools and security features designed to protect against fraudulent transactions, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Our security measures ensure that your payment processing is secure and compliant with industry standards, so you can focus on growing your business without worrying about fraud or data security.

## **2. Key Security Features**

**PCI-DSS Compliance**

Dodo Payments is fully compliant with the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**, which means we meet the highest security standards for handling, processing, and storing card information. This compliance ensures that all card transactions are processed securely and reduces the risk of data breaches.

**Data Encryption**

All sensitive data, such as payment information and personal details, is encrypted using the latest encryption technology. This ensures that your data is protected during transmission and storage, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

**Tokenization**

Instead of storing sensitive card information, Dodo Payments uses **tokenization**. This means that sensitive data is replaced with a unique identifier (token), ensuring that no card details are ever stored directly in our systems. This adds an extra layer of protection against fraud.

## **3. Fraud Prevention Tools**

**Fraud Detection**

Dodo Payments uses real-time fraud detection tools that monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This includes looking for unusual purchasing patterns, multiple failed payment attempts, or signs of account takeover. Any flagged transactions are immediately investigated, and merchants are notified if additional verification is needed.

**3D Secure Authentication**

For an added layer of protection, we support **3D Secure (3DS)**, an extra verification step for online payments. This requires customers to verify their identity (such as through a one-time password or biometric authentication) before completing a transaction, reducing the risk of unauthorized payments.

## **4. Protecting Your Account**

**Role-Based Access Control**

Using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, merchants can assign specific roles and permissions to team members. This ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information, such as financial reports or customer payment data.

---

## **5. Monitoring and Alerts**

Dodo Payments provides continuous monitoring of all transactions and account activity. If any unusual behavior or potential security threats are detected, merchants receive real-time alerts so they can take immediate action. These alerts include suspicious login attempts, unusual transaction volumes, or possible fraud attempts.
