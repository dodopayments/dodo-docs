This is an example implementation and boilerplate designed as a starting point for Figma plugin developers who want to integrate Dodo Payments license key API to grant access to their plugins. The template demonstrates complete license key validation and activation functionality, providing everything you need to create premium Figma plugins with built-in licensing.

## Features

- **License Key Validation**: Validates license keys against the Dodo Payments API
- **License Key Activation**: Activates license keys with user identification
- **Environment Support**: Configurable for both test and live environments  
- **CORS Proxy**: Uses a Cloudflare Worker proxy to handle CORS restrictions
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed implementation with proper error handling

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Base Plugin">
Create your own Figma plugin project using [Figma's plugin quickstart guide](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/). This will generate a scaffold with a `manifest.json` file.

<Tip>
This step is just to get a unique name and ID for your plugin. You can discard the generated files after committing the ID and name to your git repository in the next step.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Clone the Example Implementation">
Clone the [dodopayments-figma repository](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-figma) and update its `manifest.json` with the name and ID from your generated plugin folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-figma.git
cd dodopayments-figma
```

This example serves as your starting point for integration.

<Tip>
You need to change the remote origin URL to your own repository for version control.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment">
Set the `API_MODE` in `src/ui/api.ts`:

```typescript
const API_MODE = "test_mode"; // for development
// const API_MODE = "live_mode"; // for production
```

<Warning>
Always use `test_mode` during development to avoid processing real payments.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize Components">
Customize the plugin components to match your needs:

- Update `Authenticated.tsx` to expose functionality for users with valid license keys
- Customize `LicenseKeyInput.tsx` to match your design preferences

<Note>
The `Authenticated.tsx` component is where you'll add your plugin's premium features that require a valid license.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Network Access">
The plugin needs network access to communicate with the CORS proxy. Add the following to your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "networkAccess": {
    "allowedDomains": ["https://dodo-payments-proxy.aagarwal9782.workers.dev"]
  }
}
```

This allows the plugin to validate and activate license keys using the Dodo Payments API.

<Info>
The CORS proxy is necessary because Dodo Payments API doesn't allow API calls from browser-based applications as of now.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure API Mode">
In `src/ui/api.ts`, configure the API mode:

```typescript
const API_MODE = "test_mode"; // or "live_mode"
```

<Tip>
Switch to `live_mode` only when you're ready for production and have tested thoroughly in test mode.
</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Development

<Steps>
<Step title="Import Plugin">
Import the plugin into Figma using "Import Manifest" from the Figma desktop app.

<Note>
You'll need to have the Figma desktop app installed to develop and test plugins locally.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Start Development Server">
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the development server with file watching for automatic rebuilds.

<Check>
Your plugin will automatically rebuild when you make changes to the source code.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Build Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Build the plugin for production |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with file watching |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style and errors |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Prettier |

## License Key Integration

The example implementation includes complete license key validation and activation that you can customize for your plugin:

1. **User Input**: Users enter their license key in the plugin UI
2. **Validation**: The plugin validates the key against Dodo Payments API
3. **Activation**: Valid keys are activated with user identification
4. **Access Control**: Plugin functionality is unlocked for valid license holders

## Publishing

Once your plugin is ready:

1. Build for production: `npm run build`
2. Test thoroughly in both test and live modes
3. Follow [Figma's plugin publishing guidelines](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/publishing-plugins/)
4. Submit for review through the Figma Community

## Repository

The complete example implementation is available at: [github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-figma](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodopayments-figma)

Use this as your starting point to build your own premium Figma plugin with Dodo Payments license key integration.
