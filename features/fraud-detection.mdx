## Overview

At Dodo Payments, keeping your business and customer data safe is a top priority. We provide robust fraud prevention tools and security features designed to protect against fraudulent transactions, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Our security measures ensure that your payment processing is secure and compliant with industry standards, so you can focus on growing your business without worrying about fraud or data security.

## Security Features

### PCI-DSS Compliance

Dodo Payments is fully compliant with the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**, which means we meet the highest security standards for handling, processing, and storing card information. This compliance ensures that all card transactions are processed securely and reduces the risk of data breaches.

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data, such as payment information and personal details, is encrypted using the latest encryption technology. This ensures that your data is protected during transmission and storage, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

### Tokenization

Instead of storing sensitive card information, Dodo Payments uses **tokenization**. This means that sensitive data is replaced with a unique identifier (token), ensuring that no card details are ever stored directly in our systems. This adds an extra layer of protection against fraud.

## Fraud Prevention & Monitoring

### Real-time Fraud Detection

Dodo Payments uses real-time fraud detection tools that monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This includes looking for unusual purchasing patterns, multiple failed payment attempts, or signs of account takeover. Any flagged transactions are immediately investigated, and merchants are notified if additional verification is needed.

### Continuous Monitoring and Alerts

Dodo Payments provides continuous monitoring of all transactions and account activity. If any unusual behavior or potential security threats are detected, we will block the transactions. These include suspicious login attempts, unusual transaction volumes, or possible fraud attempts.

## Security Best Practices

To help keep your business secure, we recommend the following best practices:

* **Monitor Transactions Regularly**: Keep an eye on your transaction history for any suspicious activity.

* **Use Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords for your account and change them regularly.

* **Report** any suspicious activity to our support team
