# Introduction

This guide will walk you through setting up and securely handling webhooks.
Our implementation follows the [Standard Webhooks](https://webhookstandard.com) specification.

## Getting Started

2. Click on `Add Webhook` to create a new webhook endpoint.
1. Navigate to the DodoPayments Dashboard and go to `Settings > API Keys`.
3. Enter the URL where you want to receive webhook events.
4. Obtain your webhook `Secret Key` from the settings page. You'll use this to verify the authenticity of received webhooks.

## Webhook Delivery

### Timeouts
- Webhooks have a `10-second` timeout window, including both connection and read timeouts.
- If a webhook delivery attempt fails, we will retry sending the event using exponential backoff to avoid overloading your system.

### Retries
- We will attempt a maximum of `10 retries` for each failed webhook delivery.
- The initial retry delay is **6 seconds**, and the maximum delay between retries is capped at **6 hours**.

### Idempotency
- Each webhook event contains a unique `webhook-id` header. Use this to implement idempotency and avoid processing the same event multiple times.
- Even if you receive the same event more than once (due to retries), your system should handle it gracefully without causing errors or duplicate actions.

## Securing Webhooks

To ensure the security of your webhooks, always validate the payloads and use HTTPS.    

### Verifying Signatures

Each webhook request includes a `webhook-signature` header -- an HMAC SHA256 signature of the webhook payload and timestamp, signed with your secret key.
To verify a webhook came from DodoPayments:

1. Compute the HMAC SHA256 of this string using your webhook secret key obtained from the DodoPayments Dashboard
2. Concatenate the `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, and stringified `payload` values from the webhook with periods (`.`)  
The respective payloads for outgoing webhooks can be found in the [API Reference](/api-reference/outgoing-webhooks/post-your-webhook-url).

3. Compare the computed signature to the received `webhook-signature` header value. If they match, the webhook is authentic.

Since we follow the Standard Webhooks specification, you can use one of their libraries to verify the signature: https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries

> **Note**: When using the Standard Webhooks libraries, they expect your secret to be **encoded in Base64 first**.

### Responding to Webhooks
- Your webhook handler must return a `2xx status code` to acknowledge receipt of the event.
- Any other response will be treated as a failure, and the webhook will be retried.
