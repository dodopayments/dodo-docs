## Introduction

The **Invoice Generation** feature is designed to automate the entire invoicing process, allowing merchants to focus on their business instead of handling paperwork. Every time a transaction is completed, whether it's for a one-time purchase or a subscription renewal, an invoice is automatically created and sent to the customer. Merchants can customize these invoices in advance, ensuring they align with their brand and provide all necessary details.

Invoices can be accessed through the dashboard, where merchants can download, or manage them as needed.
