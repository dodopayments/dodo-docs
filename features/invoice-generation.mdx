## Introduction

The **Invoice Generation** feature is designed to automate the entire invoicing process, allowing merchants to focus on their business instead of handling paperwork. Every time a transaction is completed, whether it’s for a one-time purchase or a subscription renewal, an invoice is automatically created and sent to the customer. Merchants can customize these invoices in advance, ensuring they align with their brand and provide all necessary details.

Invoices can be accessed through the dashboard, where merchants can download, or manage them as needed.

## Invoice Customization

Before the invoice generation system can be used, merchants must configure their invoice settings. This allows merchants to ensure that all invoices reflect their business’s branding.

### Configuration Options:

* **Branding**: Upload your company logo and brand name. This ensures that your invoices have a professional appearance.

### How to Configure:

1. Go to the **Settings** section of the Dodo Payments dashboard and open **Business Profile Tab**.

2. Upload your business logo and add your business name to be displayed on the invoice.

3. Save the settings, and your invoices will automatically use these customizations moving forward.

### Triggers for Invoice Generation:

* **One-Time Purchases**: Any single purchase of a product or service.

* **Subscription Payments**: Recurring payments, such as monthly or yearly subscription renewals.

## Automatic Invoice Generation

Once the payment is successfully processed, the Dodo Payments system automatically generates an invoice.

## Invoice Access and Management

Merchants can view, manage, and resend invoices from the **Invoices** section in the Dodo Payments dashboard. This section provides a comprehensive view of all generated invoices, allowing merchants to easily track payments.

### Features of the Invoices Section:

* **Filter Invoices**: Use filters to search for invoices by date, customer name, or status for quicker access to specific invoices.
