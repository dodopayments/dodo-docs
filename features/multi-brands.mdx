## Introduction

Multi-Brand lets you attach several brands—each with its own logo, descriptor, and website URL—to **one verified business**. Your payout account, fees, and KYC stay exactly the same, while every Product, Payment Link, Subscription, Invoice, and Transaction can now be filed under a specific brand. Use it to test new niches, localise a site, or separate B2B and B2C lines without opening extra business accounts.

## Merchant Dashboard Flow

## Additional Points

- **No payout changes:** All funds, payout cycles and fees still flow to the business-level wallet and merchant bank account.
- **Suspensions:** If a brand is suspended, only its payment links stop—other brands under the same business keep transacting.
- No changes to Storefront, Invoices, License Keys, Discount Codes, Payout Settings and any other business level features.
