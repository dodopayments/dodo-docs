## Overview

Usage-based billing allows you to charge customers based on their actual consumption of your product or service, rather than a fixed subscription fee. This flexible pricing model is ideal for SaaS platforms, APIs, cloud services, and any business where customer value correlates directly with usage.

## Core Components

The usage-based billing system consists of several interconnected components:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Events" icon="bolt">
    Real-time data points that capture when usage occurs in your application. Each event contains metadata about the usage activity.
</Card>
<Card title="Meters" icon="sliders">
    Configuration rules that define how events are aggregated, filtered, and measured for billing purposes.
</Card>
<Card title="Products" icon="box">
    Billing entities that link meters to pricing rules, determining how usage translates to charges.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data Flow

The billing process follows this sequence:

1. **Event Generation**: Your application sends usage events to Dodo Payments
2. **Event Processing**: Events are validated and routed to appropriate meters
3. **Aggregation**: Meters calculate usage totals based on configured rules
4. **Billing**: Usage totals are converted to charges using product pricing
5. **Invoicing**: Charges are included in customer invoices for the billing period
