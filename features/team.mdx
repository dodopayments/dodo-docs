## Roles and Permissions

The Dodo Dashboard has three types of user roles, each with different levels of access. The role icon of the user can be seen in the bottom left of the dashboard.

### 1. Owner

The **Owner** has the highest level of access and full control over the account. Only the account owner holds this role and has the exclusive ability to invite new users. The ownership of the account cannot be transferred.

### 2. Editor

Editors have almost the same permissions as the Owner, except they cannot invite new Editors. However, they can invite and remove users with the Viewer role. Additionally, they can create, edit, and delete products and make other modifications within the dashboard.

### 3. Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to the dashboard. They can view all information, including products, transactions, and reports, but cannot add, edit, or delete products or make any modifications.
