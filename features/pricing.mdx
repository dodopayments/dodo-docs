description: The Pricing can be set for every product while creating or editing a product. Sales Tax will be charged above this price based on the customer’s location by default. If you want to show the final price to your customer upfront and bear the cost of the sales tax you can enable Tax Inclusive Pricing toggle while creating or editing a product.

## **Tax Inclusive Pricing**
The Tax Inclusive Pricing feature allows merchants to embed applicable taxes directly into the product prices. Customers see one final amount upfront, creating a transparent and seamless shopping experience. The system automatically calculates the tax-exclusive portion and the tax amount during checkout, ensuring compliance and clarity on invoices.

### **Merchant Flow**

    - **Enable the “Tax Inclusive Pricing” toggle** below the price field.
    - A short note appears when “Tax Inclusive Pricing” is toggled:
      > Enable this option to include applicable taxes in the displayed product price. Taxes will vary based on customer location.
      > 
3. **Save**
    - Click **Save Product**.
    - The system will now treat the listed price as **final** (including tax).

### **Checkout and Invoice Flow**

#### **Checkout Flow**

1. **Customer Views Product**
    - The **tax-inclusive** price is labeled as such (e.g., “$100 (Tax Inclusive)”).
2. **Price at Checkout**
    - Taxes are **calculated** based on the **customer’s location**.
    - The checkout page lists:
        - The **tax-inclusive** price of the product.
        - A **tax breakdown** for clarity.
3. **Payment**
    - The customer is charged exactly the final, tax-inclusive amount they saw from the start.

#### **Invoice**

- After the purchase:
    - An **invoice** is generated showing:
        - **Product Price** (Tax Inclusive)
        - **Tax Amount** extracted from that price
        - **Net Amount** (price without tax)
    - This structure confirms the total paid and tax details.


With Tax Inclusive Pricing, you provide final, tax-included figures upfront, giving customers full clarity and ensuring invoices display compliant breakdowns.

## **Pay What you Want Pricing**


**Pay What You Want (PWYW)** is a pricing strategy that allows customers to decide how much they will pay for a product—above or at a minimum threshold set by the merchant. This can boost engagement, encourage community support, and allow for greater flexibility in how merchants price their offerings.

### **Key Highlights**

- **Customer-Driven Pricing**: The buyer chooses the price they pay.
- **Minimum Threshold**: Merchants set a required minimum. This should be at least $0.5 or Rs.5
- **Suggested Price** (Optional): You can display a recommended or typical value to guide customers.
- This option is only available for One-Time Payment products.

### **Merchant Flow**

1. **Enable PWYW**
    - From the dashboard, create or edit a product and select Pricing as Single Payment
    - Enable Toggle **“ Pay What You Want ”** under the pricing section.
2. **Set Minimum Price**
    - Enter the **Minimum** price. This should be at least $0.5 or Rs.5
    - If you wish, enter a **“Suggested Price”** that appears on the product page to guide customers. This should be at least $0.5 or Rs.5
3. **Confirm & Save**
    - Save your settings. The product is now **Pay What You Want** enabled.
4. **Preview & Share**
    - Once saved, customers on your storefront or via your checkout link will see the PWYW field.
    - Review the checkout preview to ensure everything looks correct (e.g., the minimum price, suggested price)
    - Share the link or embed the product as usual.
5. **Monitor Transactions**
    - In your dashboard, each sale’s **“paid amount”** might vary so you can monitor the transactions in detail.

### **Customer Flow**

1. **Product Page**
    - The shopper lands on the product listing. They see an input field to set their price  with a **suggested**(if provided) & **minimum** price.
2. **Input Their Price**
    - The customer types any amount that meets or exceeds the **minimum**.
3. **Checkout**
    - The checkout summary will display their chosen amount.
    - They complete payment as usual (card, wallet, etc.), paying exactly what they entered.
4. **Confirmation**
    - They can see how much they paid in their invoice sent via email.

### **Points to Remember**

1. **Suggested Price vs. Minimum Price**
    - **Minimum Price**: Ensures you recoup at least a nominal amount
    - **Suggested Price**: Helps anchor a “typical” or “recommended” rate, which can influence average payments positively.
2. **Refund & Support**
    - Refund logic remains the same as other products. If a user requests a refund, they’d be refunded whatever they initially paid.
