## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks are HTTP POST callbacks triggered by specific events in the Dodo Payments system. They send structured data in JSON format to a pre-configured endpoint, notifying your application about events like successful payments, failed transactions, or subscription updates.

## Adding Webhook URL

To receive status updates on all events in the ecosystem such as transactions, product creation and updates, complete the webhook setup.

**Note:** Webhooks created in Test mode will be limited to the test mode environment and vice versa for live mode.
