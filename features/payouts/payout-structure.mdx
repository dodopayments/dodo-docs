  2. Payouts will be processed on or before the 15th of every month for the previous month's billing cycle. So for November billing cycle, Payouts will be processed by 15th of December&#x20;

Note: If the payout processing date falls on weekends/bank holidays for a given month then there may be a slight delay for the amount to reach your bank account.

  2. If merchant makes a request for a different currency we will take it up on a case to case basis

  2. If the payout does not meet the threshold it will carry forward to the next payout cycle
