## **Introduction**

The **Product Catalogue** feature in Dodo Payments allows merchants to effectively manage their offerings, whether they are one-time payment products or subscription-based products. This feature provides the flexibility to create, edit, and remove products based on changing business requirements, enabling you to offer a wide variety of digital products.

## **Key Highlights of the Feature**

Here are some key features of the **Product Catalogue** that make managing your products and subscriptions easier:

### **Create a Product**

Create products that you offer and configure pricing, description and other details to enhance your product catalogue

### **Edit a Product**

Update product information, such as descriptions, prices, and billing cycles to keep your product catalogue in sync with your business updates

### **Delete a Product**

Easily remove products or subscriptions that are no longer relevant, ensuring your catalogue stays up-to-date

## **Product Type**

The following type of Products are supported by Dodo Payments:

<Card title="One Time Payment Products" horizontal icon="box" href="/features/product-catalog/one-time-payment-products">
  Learn about one-time payment products
</Card>

<Card title="Subscription Products" horizontal icon="repeat" href="/features/product-catalog/subscription">
  Learn about subscription products
</Card>

## **Pricing**
The Pricing can be set for every product while creating or editing a product. Sales Tax will be charged above this price based on the customer’s location by default. If you want to show the final price to your customer upfront and bear the cost of the sales tax you can enable Tax Inclusive Pricing toggle while creating or editing a product.

### **Tax Inclusive Pricing**
The Tax Inclusive Pricing feature allows merchants to embed applicable taxes directly into the product prices. Customers see one final amount upfront, creating a transparent and seamless shopping experience. The system automatically calculates the tax-exclusive portion and the tax amount during checkout, ensuring compliance and clarity on invoices.

    - A short note appears when “Tax Inclusive Pricing” is toggled:
      > Enable this option to include applicable taxes in the displayed product price. Taxes will vary based on customer location.
      > 
3. **Save**
    - Click **Save Product**.
    - The system will now treat the listed price as **final** (including tax).

    - Click **Edit** and adjust the “Tax Inclusive Pricing” toggle as needed.

## **2. Checkout and Invoice Flow**

### **Checkout Flow**

1. **Customer Views Product**
    - The **tax-inclusive** price is labeled as such (e.g., “$100 (Tax Inclusive)”).
2. **Price at Checkout**
    - Taxes are **calculated** based on the **customer’s location**.
    - The checkout page lists:
        - The **tax-inclusive** price of the product.
        - A **tax breakdown** for clarity.
3. **Payment**
    - The customer is charged exactly the final, tax-inclusive amount they saw from the start.

### **Invoice**

- After the purchase:
    - An **invoice** is generated showing:
        - **Product Price** (Tax Inclusive)
        - **Tax Amount** extracted from that price
        - **Net Amount** (price without tax)
    - This structure confirms the total paid and tax details.


With Tax Inclusive Pricing, you provide final, tax-included figures upfront, giving customers full clarity and ensuring invoices display compliant breakdowns.
