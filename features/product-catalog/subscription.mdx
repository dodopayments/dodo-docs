## Subscription
Below are the step by step ways by which you can do various actions

### Add a Subscription Product

Merchants can create subscription-based products for offerings that require recurring payments, such as software subscriptions, content memberships, or subscription boxes. This is a powerful way to generate consistent revenue while providing ongoing value to your customers.

**How to Add a Subscription Product:**

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**:

   * Log in to your Dodo Payments dashboard.

2. **Go to the Products Section**:

   * From the sidebar menu, click on **Products** to view your current catalogue.

3. **Add a New Product**:

   * Click the **Add New Product** button.

   * Select the **Subscription** option in **Pricing type**

4. **Enter Subscription Details**:

   * **Subscription Name**: Provide a descriptive name for the subscription plan (e.g., "Premium Membership" or "Monthly Box Subscription").

   * **Description**: Write a detailed explanation of what the subscription includes, its benefits, and any special features.

   * **Pricing**: Set the recurring price (e.g: $100/year).

5. **Configure the Billing Cycle**:

   * Set how often the customer will be billed (e.g., **monthly**, **quarterly**, **yearly**). You can also create custom billing intervals if needed.

6. **Optional: Add a Free Trial Period**:

   * Offer a **Free Trial** period to attract new subscribers. For example, provide a 7-day or 30-day trial, after which the customer will be automatically billed if they don’t cancel. You can do this by selecting the first payment date post the trial period.

7. **Save the Subscription**:

   * After entering all the details, click **Save** to add the subscription plan to your product catalogue. The plan will now be available for customers to subscribe to

### **Edit an Existing Subscription Product**

Subscription products can be updated or modified at any time. Merchants can adjust pricing, billing intervals, or descriptions as the business evolves, ensuring that your subscription offerings remain competitive and relevant.

**How to Edit an Existing Subscription Product:**

1. **Access the Products Section**:

   * From your dashboard, go to the **Products** section.

2. **Locate the Subscription Plan**:

   * Find the subscription plan you wish to edit by scrolling through your list of products

3. **Make Changes**:

   * Update any necessary details, such as:

     * **Billing Cycle**: Adjust how often the customer is billed (e.g., change from monthly to quarterly).

     * **Price**: Modify the recurring price for new customers.

     * **Description or Benefits**: Add more information or refine the plan's offerings.

4. **Save Changes**:

   * Once changes are made, click **Save** to apply the updates.

<Info>Changes to subscription pricing or terms will only affect new customers or future subscription renewals. Existing subscribers will continue with their current terms. Please contact support to make changes for existing customers.</Info>

### **Delete a Subscription Product**

If you decide to discontinue a subscription product, you can remove it from the Product Catalogue. This will prevent new customers from signing up, but it won’t affect current subscribers who are already enrolled.

**How to Delete a Subscription Product:**

1. **Access the Products Section**:

   * From the dashboard, go to the **Products** section to view your current subscription plans.

2. **Find the Subscription Plan to Delete**:

   * Scroll through or search for the subscription plan you want to remove.

3. **Delete the Subscription**:

   * Click the **Delete** button next to the subscription product.

   * Confirm the deletion when prompted.

<Info>Deleting a subscription product will not affect existing subscribers. They will continue to receive the subscription on the terms they initially purchased the subscription. To delete subscription for existing customers reach out to our support.</Info>

### Subscriptions Payment Flow

The diagram below shows how a subscription moves from its initial setup (when a customer first provides payment details) through recurring renewal attempts. It outlines what happens if payment succeeds or fails during mandate creation and each renewal, and how the subscription status changes depending on whether it’s active, canceled, or expires.

  </Frame>

    <img src="/images/subscriptions/payment-renewal.png" />
  </Frame>

### Subscription Cancellation

Subscription can be cancelled by the merchant through his dashboard/API or the customer using the customer portal 

Once the subscription is cancelled, the status is changed to cancelled immediately and we provide the same information to the merchant and display it on the dashboard and customer portal. No further payment will be initiated on the next payment date for cancelled subscriptions however the payment for the end of the current billing period is already collected as cancel subscription does not provide any refund automatically to the customer, hence the merchant is expected to provide the subscription to the customer until the end of the ongoing billing period.

## **Using On-Demand Subscriptions**

On-demand subscriptions allow you to charge customers flexibly, rather than strictly on a recurring schedule.

### Enabling On-Demand Subscriptions

To enable on-demand subscriptions, contact **Dodo Payments Support**. Once enabled for your business, you'll have access to create and manage on-demand subscriptions.

### Creating an On-Demand Subscription

To create an on-demand subscription, use the [POST /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions) API endpoint.

Include the `on_demand` field in your request body to activate on-demand functionality:

```json
"on_demand": {
  "mandate_only": true, // Set to true to authorize payment method without immediate charge
  "product_price": 5000 // Optional: initial product price; defaults to stored product price if omitted
}

```

#### Fields Description:

- `mandate_only` (boolean, required):
    - If set to `true`, no immediate charge is performed. Instead, this authorizes the payment method details for future charges.
- `product_price` (integer, optional):
    - Sets the initial price for the product charged to the customer.
    - If not provided, the system defaults to the stored product price.

### Charging an On-Demand Subscription

For subsequent charges on an existing on-demand subscription, use the following endpoint. Try it out in the [API Explorer](/api-reference/misc/charge-subscriptions):

```
POST /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/charge

```

#### Parameters

- `subscription_id` (string, path, required): Subscription ID.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "product_price": 7500
}

```

- `product_price` (integer, required): The amount you wish to charge the customer for this transaction.

#### Response

A successful charge will return HTTP status `200` with the following response body:

```json
{
  "payment_id": "string"
}

```

This flexibility allows you to manage charges according to your business requirements.



## Add-On

An **Add-On** is an optional, paid enhancement that can be bundled with a subscription. It allows you to offer additional value to your customers on top of their primary subscription. Add-Ons follow the same billing cycle as the associated subscription and cannot be purchased independently.

For example, if you're offering a SaaS product subscription, Add-Ons can include extras like:

- Additional Credits
- Additional User Seats
- Extra Storage Space
- Feature Packs

<Info>
Add-Ons are billed in sync with the main subscription (monthly, yearly, etc.). Customers can select a quantity of each Add-On during checkout.
</Info>

### Merchant Workflow

#### Step 1: Create an Add-On

To create an Add-On:

1. Navigate to the **Products** section in your dashboard.
2. Click on **Create Add-On**.
    
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/addons/1.png" alt="Create Add-On" />
    </Frame>
    
3. Fill in the following details:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/addons/2.png" alt="Create Add-On Form" />
</Frame>

- **Name**: A short, descriptive name for the Add-On (e.g., "5 Extra Seats").
- **Description**: Explain what the Add-On offers.
- **Price & Currency**: Set the recurring price and select the applicable currency.
- **Tax Category**: Assign a tax category for accurate tax calculation.
- **Image**: (Optional) Upload a relevant image or icon for the Add-On.
4. Click **Create** to save the Add-On.

<Tip>
Create Add-Ons that align with common customer needs or upgrade paths.
</Tip>

#### Step 2: Associate Add-Ons with a Subscription

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/addons/3.png" alt="Associate Add-Ons with a Subscription" />
</Frame>

Each subscription plan can be associated with up to **3 Add-Ons**. To do this:

1. While creating or editing a subscription plan, scroll to the **Add-Ons** section.
2. Select up to three relevant Add-Ons from the list.
3. Save your changes.

These Add-Ons will now appear as optional purchases when a customer selects this subscription.

#### Step 3: Customer Checkout Experience

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/addons/4.png" alt="Customer Checkout Experience" />
</Frame>

When a customer selects a subscription plan:

- The associated Add-Ons will be displayed on the **Checkout Page**.
- Customers can choose the quantity (if applicable) for each Add-On.
- The total subscription cost will update accordingly.

All selected Add-Ons will be billed **together** with the base subscription at the defined frequency.

**The Add-Ons will be reflected in the invoice as well**

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/addons/5.png" alt="Invoice with Add-Ons" />
</Frame>

### Important Notes

- Add-Ons **cannot exist independently** – they must be tied to a subscription.
- The **payment frequency** of an Add-On will always match the subscription (e.g., monthly or annually).
- Add-Ons can only be created and managed from the **Products** section → Add-ons tab in your dashboard.
