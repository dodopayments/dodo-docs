## Initiate Refund

You can initiate two types of refunds from the Payment Details Page:

- **Full refund**: Refunds the entire payment amount to the customer.
- **Partial refund**: Refunds only a portion of the payment amount, as specified by you.

To begin, click the **Initiate Refund** button. The refund will only proceed if all refund rules are met.

Partial refunds are useful when only a portion of the order needs to be refunded.

### Details Required for Refund

* **Refund Amount**: The amount to be refunded. For partial refunds, enter the specific amount you wish to return to the customer. The system will prevent you from refunding more than the original payment.

* **Refund Reason**: The reason for the refund, to be recorded in the system.

### Refund Rules

1. The payment must have been successful.

2. Refunds (full or partial) must be initiated within 30 days of the transaction date. Initiating refunds will not be allowed post that.

3. Refunds are issued to the original payment method used by the customer.

If any rule is violated, the refund request will be denied. Please reach out to support for assistance if needed.

## Refunds Page

The **Refunds Page** provides a detailed view of all refund transactions:&#x20;

* Clicking the **Associated Payment ID** will take the merchant to the **Payment Details Page** for that transaction.

* Merchants can export the refund report in CSV format for a specified date range.

## Refund Receipt

Once a refund is successfully processed, a **Refund Receipt** is automatically sent to the customer.
