## **Payments Listing Page**

  * **Failed**: The payment attempt was unsuccessful.

  * **Successful**: The payment was completed successfully.

<Info>The payment method and timestamp are updated once the payment is completed.</Info>

Upon clicking a payment in the listing, merchants are directed to the **Payment Details Page**, which provides a comprehensive breakdown of the transaction


## **Important Information**

* **Automatic Activation**: All the payment methods listed above will become available to customers automatically once the merchant's account is verified and live mode is enabled.

* **No Additional Configuration Required**: Merchants do not need to configure these payment options, as they are pre-defined and managed by Dodo Payments.

* **Additional Payment Methods**: We are constantly adding more payment methods to our roster. We will keep updating this page as and when we add more methods. If you have a requirement for any particular payment method, please write to us at [support@dodopayments.com](mailto:support@dodopayments.com) and we will add this to our roadmap if not present.
