## **1. Introduction**

The **Atlas Demo Product** is a demo site by **Dodo Payments** that showcases how **digital products** (like software licenses, digital downloads, or online memberships) can be sold using our **checkout** solution. Merchants can see both **subscription** and **one-time purchase** flows in action.

**Key Points**:

- **URL**: [atlas.dodopayments.com](https://atlas.dodopayments.com/)
- Only **digital products** are featured as we do not support physical goods as of now
- **Two separate flows** are demonstrated:
    1. **Subscription Product Flow**
    2. **One-Time Purchase Flow**
- After completing a purchase, users can visit the **“My Account”** section to see the digital products they’ve acquired.

## **2. Purchase Flows**

### **Subscription Flow**

1. **Select a Subscription Product**: Choose a monthly or annual plan for a dummy e-book subscription. 
2. **Add to Cart**: The item is added to a cart and user is taken to the checkout
3. **Checkout**:
    - The user proceeds to Dodo Payments’ **subscription checkout** page with Merchant brand name and logo visible. **This showcases the No-Code Checkout Interface**.
    - User details and billing address have to be entered and post confirmation, taxes are calculated and total amount and payment details are displayed
    - Enter test card details and make a payment to simulate transaction
4. **Payment Confirmation**: Post-payment, Atlas displays a **confirmation** with subscription details.
5. **My Account**: The newly subscribed plan appears under “My Account,” indicating active digital access.

### **One-Time Purchase Flow**

1. **Select One-Time Digital Item and quantity**: E.g., a single download or license for an app/tool.
2. **Add to Cart** : Product is added to your cart. You can add multiple products and proceed to checkout 
3. **Checkout**:
    - The user is taken to the **one-time purchase** checkout flow powered by Dodo Payments with Merchant branding visible. **This showcases the API based Flow**
    - User details and billing address have to be entered and post confirmation, taxes are calculated and total amount and payment details are displayed
    - Enter test card details and make a payment to simulate transaction
4. **Payment Confirmation**: Post-payment, Atlas displays a **confirmation** and user sees a “thank you” screen.
5. **My Account**: The purchased product is now accessible in the “My Account” section, denoting they own the digital asset.

## **3. Post-Purchase “My Account” Section**

One highlight of the Atlas demo is that it **tracks** which digital items a user has purchased:

- **Account Page**: After login, users can see a list of their **recent purchases** (subscription or one-time).
- **Access or Download Links**: Depending on the product type, the user might see a “Download” button or “Access Now” link, illustrating how merchants can **deliver digital content** post-payment.
