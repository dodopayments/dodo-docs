## Subscription Cancellation

You or your customers can cancel subscriptions at any time via the dashboard or customer portal. Cancellation takes effect immediately, but access continues until the end of the current billing period. No automatic refunds are issued for cancellations.



## On-Demand Subscriptions

<Info>
On-demand subscriptions let you charge customers flexibly, not just on a fixed schedule. Contact support to enable this feature.
</Info>

**To create an on-demand subscription:**

To create an on-demand subscription, use the [POST /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions) API endpoint and include the `on_demand` field in your request body. This allows you to authorize a payment method without an immediate charge, or set a custom initial price.

**To charge an on-demand subscription:**

For subsequent charges, use the [POST /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/charge](/api-reference/misc/charge-subscriptions) endpoint and specify the amount to charge the customer for that transaction.
