title: UPI
description: Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system widely used in India. It allows customers to pay directly from their bank accounts using a Virtual Payment Address (VPA) —no additional bank details are needed. When using Dodo Payments, Indian merchants can offer UPI as a payment method for their Indian customers, ensuring a streamlined, local checkout experience.

## Product Creation

Merchants on Dodo Payments have two options when creating products:

1. **INR-based Products**
    - You can set the product base price in INR if you primarily sell to Indian customers.
    - At checkout, the final amount is directly charged in INR, with no currency conversion required.
2. **USD-based Products**
    - You can set the product base price in USD if you cater to a global audience.
    - If you (the merchant) are in India **and** the customer’s billing country is also India, the system converts the USD price to INR **in real time** and displays it to the customer in INR.

## UPI Checkout Flow

1. **Customer Chooses UPI**
    - On the checkout page, the customer selects **UPI** as their payment method.
2. **UPI Details**
    - The customer enters their **UPI ID** on the checkout page.
3. **Payment Authorization**
    - The customer authorizes the transaction in their chosen UPI app (e.g., Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM).
    - They either **approve** or **reject** the request within the app.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**
    - Once approved, payment is processed in real time.
    - The customer is then redirected or shown a success screen with confirmation details.
5. **Order Finalization**
    - DodoPayments sends a **callback/webhook** to your system confirming the transaction status.

## Payment Processing

- **Local INR Processing**:
    - All INR transactions (including those converted from USD to INR) are shown in INR on the dashboard and invoices.
- **No Direct Bank Details**:
    - Since UPI is a bank-to-bank payment system, customers do not need to share sensitive bank information on your site. They simply make the payment via their UPI app.

## Testing UPI Payments

To ensure a smooth go-live, merchants can test UPI transactions in the **Dodo Payments Test Mode**:

1. **Select Test Mode**
    - In your Dodo Payments dashboard, enable the test mode button on the bottom left corner
2. **Copy Payment Link for Test product**
    - Create a test product and copy the payment link by clicking share button for that product.
    - Paste the link in a new browser
    - Select your billing country as India to see UPI payment option
3. **Use Test UPI IDs**
    - The checkout page provides test UPI IDs in the view test payment methods section
    - Approving or rejecting a payment in the test environment simulates the exact flow in production.
    - The UPI test payments usually take 1-2 mins for the transaction to be processed. Please remain patient during this period.
4. **Validate Callbacks**
    - Check that your system properly receives and processes the **webhook notifications** (success/failure).
    - Confirm the correct display of INR amounts (and USD prices, if applicable).

## Dashboard & Invoices

**Transactions & Ledger**

- Each transaction page shows the **final charged amount** in INR (for UPI).

**Invoices**

- Whenever a customer completes a purchase via UPI in INR, the invoice will display the amount and applicable taxes in INR only


By integrating **UPI** with Dodo Payments, Indian merchants can offer a highly popular, convenient payment option to their local customers—whether products are priced in INR or converted from USD.
