## Overview

Dodo Payments API uses standard HTTP status codes and custom error codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON response containing detailed information about the error.

Each error response includes:
- An HTTP status code indicating the general category of the error
- A specific error code that identifies the exact nature of the error
- A human-readable error message explaining what went wrong
- Additional details about the error when applicable

Understanding these error codes and their meanings is crucial for:
- Debugging integration issues
- Implementing proper error handling in your application
- Providing meaningful feedback to end users
- Maintaining a robust payment processing system

The following sections provide detailed information about standard HTTP status codes and specific error codes you may encounter when using the Dodo Payments API.
