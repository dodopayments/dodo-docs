description: This guide will help you integrate the Dodo Payments API into your website.
---

## Prerequisites

To integrate the Dodo Payments API, you'll need:
- A Dodo Payments merchant account
- API credentials

If you don't have an account yet, you can get your business approved by [contacting the founder](https://demo.dodopayments.com/) or by filling out this [form](https://dodopayments.com/early-access).

## Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to the [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/)

2. Create a product (one-time payment or subscription)
    - [Detailed Guide](/guides/one-time-product)
    
3. Test the checkout flow:
   - Click the share button on the product page
   - Open the link in your browser
   - Use test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Enter any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVV

4. Generate your API key:
   - Go to Settings > API
   - [Detailed Guide](/guides/api-key-generation)

5. Configure webhooks:
   - Go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Create a webhook URL for payment notifications
   - [Detailed Guide](/guides/webhook-setup)

## API Integration

### Payment Links

Dodo Payments supports two types of payment links:

#### 1. Static Payment Links

Simple to create by appending your product ID to the base URL:
```
https://checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/{productid}?quantity=1?redirect_url={your website return_url}
```
This link will accept the following query parameters:
- `quantity`: The quantity of the product to be purchased. The default is 1.
- `redirect_url`: The URL to redirect the customer to after the payment is completed.

You can directly use this link to redirect your customers to the checkout page from your website.

#### 2. Dynamic Payment Links
Created via API call with customer details. Here's an example using Next.js:

There are two APIs for creating dynamic payment links:

- One-time Payment Link API [API reference](/api-reference/payments/post-payments)
- Subscription Payment Link API [API reference](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions)

The guide below is for one-time payment link creation. The same structure is followed for subscription payment link creation, but you need to pass the subscription product ID, and instead of a product cart, it accepts quantity and product_id.

```javascript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";      

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    const { formData, cartItems } = paymentRequestSchema.parse(body);

    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_TEST_API}/payments`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_API_KEY}`, // Replace with your API secret key generated from the Dodo Payments Dashboard
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        billing: {
          city: formData.city,
          country: formData.country,
          state: formData.state,
          street: formData.addressLine,
          zipcode: parseInt(formData.zipCode),
        },
        customer: {
          email: formData.email,
          name: `${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}`,
          phone_number: formData.phoneNumber || undefined,
        },
        payment_link: true,
        product_cart: cartItems.map((id) => ({
          product_id: id,
          quantity: 1,
        })),
        return_url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RETURN_URL,
      }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => null);
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Payment link creation failed", details: errorData },
        { status: response.status }
      );
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    return NextResponse.json({ paymentLink: data.payment_link });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Payment error:", err);
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: err instanceof Error ? err.message : "An unknown error occurred",
      },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

For detailed API request body requirements, consult our [API Reference](/api-reference/payments/post-payments). After creating the payment link, redirect your customers to complete their payment.

### Implementing Webhooks

Set up an API endpoint to receive payment notifications. Here's an example using Next.js:

```javascript
import { Webhook } from "standardwebhooks";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { WebhookPayload } from "@/types/api-types";

const webhook = new Webhook(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_WEBHOOK_KEY!); // Replace with your secret key generated from the Dodo Payments Dashboard

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const headersList = headers();
  const rawBody = await request.text();

  const webhookHeaders = {
    "webhook-id": headersList.get("webhook-id") || "",
    "webhook-signature": headersList.get("webhook-signature") || "",
    "webhook-timestamp": headersList.get("webhook-timestamp") || "",
  };

  await webhook.verify(rawBody, webhookHeaders);
  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody) as WebhookPayload;
  
  // Process the payload according to your business logic
}
```

Our webhook implementation follows the [Standard Webhooks](https://standardwebhooks.com/) specification. For webhook type definitions, refer to our [API Reference](/api-reference/misc/outgoing-webhooks).

You can refer to this project with demo implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodopayments/dodo-checkout-demo) using Next.js and TypeScript.

You can check out the live implementation [here](https://atlas.dodopayments.com/).
