## Onboarding and Verification

### Q1: Why didn't I receive the product id in the payment.succeeded webhook for a subscription product? 

A: The payment.succeeded webhook event for subscription products does not include a product_id. Instead, it provides the `subscription_id` associated with the subscription, along with other relevant details.

### Q2: How do I verify the webhooks I receive are actually from dodo payments and not from any malicious actors?
A: To verify that the webhooks you receive are genuinely from Dodo Payments and not from malicious actors, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Signature**: Each webhook sent by Dodo Payments includes a unique signature in the **`webhook-signature`** header. This signature is generated using your webhook’s secret key and the payload of the event.
2. **Retrieve the Secret Key**: Ensure you have the secret key for your webhook, which can be found in your Dodo Payments dashboard under the Webhooks settings.
3. **Recompute the Signature**: Use the same signing algorithm (HMAC-SHA256) as Dodo Payments to compute the signature on your server. Use the payload of the webhook and your webhook secret key.
4. **Compare Signatures**: Compare the recomputed signature with the one provided in the **`webhook-signature`** header. If they match, the webhook is authentic; if not, it should be rejected.
5. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure your webhook endpoint uses HTTPS to secure communication and prevent tampering during data transmission.

By implementing these steps, you can confidently verify the authenticity of webhooks sent by Dodo Payments.

### Q3: Why am I receiving a subscription.renew webhook even for the first month payment?
A: You receive the `subscription.renew` webhook even for the first month’s payment because, for subscriptions, we first process a $0 mandate to authenticate the payment method. When the actual subscription amount is charged for the first time, it triggers the subscription.renew event. 

### Q4: How long does it take to deduct the payment after a successful mandate is created?

A: For non-Indian cards, the first payment is typically deducted within 2-10 minutes after the successful creation of the mandate.
For Indian cards, as per RBI guidelines, the first payment takes up to 24 hours to be processed successfully.

### Q5: How can I test webhooks locally?

A: To test webhooks locally, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use a Tunneling Tool**: Tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), [LocalTunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/), or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) can expose your local server to the internet. This provides a public URL that Dodo Payments can use to send webhook events to your local environment.
2. **Set Up the Webhook Endpoint**: Create a webhook endpoint in your local application to handle incoming webhook events. Ensure it listens for HTTP POST requests.
3. **Configure the Webhook in Dodo Payments**: Go to your Dodo Payments dashboard, navigate to the Webhooks settings, and update the webhook URL to the public URL generated by the tunneling tool.
4. **Trigger Events**:  Perform actions in your environment to trigger webhook events. For example, you can simulate payments or subscription renewals.
5. **Inspect Incoming Requests**: Use the tunneling tool’s logs or your application’s logging to inspect the incoming webhook payloads. This allows you to verify that your endpoint is receiving the events and processing them correctly.
6. **Verify Signature**: Ensure you validate the **`webhook-signature`** header to confirm that the webhook events are authentic and sent by Dodo Payments.

By following these steps, you can easily test and debug webhooks in your local development environment.
