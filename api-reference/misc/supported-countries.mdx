<Tip> You will receive a list of [ISO Alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country codes representing the countries we **currently support for payments**. You can view the full list of supported countries [here](/miscellaneous/list-of-countries-we-accept-payments-from). This list is updated regularly as we expand our coverage. </Tip>

<Tip> Note: The available options include ISO Alpha-2 codes for **all countries**, not just the ones we currently support. Please refer to the supported countries list to confirm availability. </Tip>
