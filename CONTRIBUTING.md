## Development Process

### File Structure

```
dodo-docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ api-reference/      # API endpoint documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ changelog/          # Version history and updates
â”œâ”€â”€ developer-resources/# Integration guides and SDKs
â”œâ”€â”€ features/          # Platform feature documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ images/            # Screenshots and diagrams
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/      # Third-party integration guides
â””â”€â”€ miscellaneous/     # FAQs, guides, and other resources
```

### Writing Documentation

1. **Create/Edit MDX Files**
   - Use `.mdx` extension for all documentation files
   - Place files in appropriate directories
   - Follow kebab-case naming: `payment-methods.mdx`

2. **Add Frontmatter**
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Your Page Title"
   description: "A brief description of the page content"
   icon: "credit-card"
   ---
   ```

3. **Update Navigation**
   - Edit `docs.json` to include your new page (if you have created one)
   - Maintain logical grouping and hierarchy

## Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and short sentences
- **Use Active Voice**: "Click the button" instead of "The button should be clicked"
- **Be Consistent**: Use the same terminology throughout
- **Include Examples**: Show, don't just tell

### Formatting Guidelines


#### Code Blocks
````mdx
```javascript
// Use language-specific syntax highlighting
const apiKey = process.env.DODO_API_KEY;
```
````
Use `expandable` after the language tag, such as `javascript expandable`, if the code block exceeds 4 lines.

#### Images
```mdx
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/feature-name/step-1.png" alt="Descriptive alt text" />
</Frame>
```

### Component Usage Example

Dodo Payments uses Mintlify to maintain its documentation page. Please check the [Mintlify Documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs) for all available components.

#### Cards
```mdx
<Card title="Feature Title" icon="icon-name" href="/link">
  Brief description of the feature
</Card>
```

#### Callouts
```mdx
<Note>
  Important information that users should know
</Note>

<Warning>
  Critical information about potential issues
</Warning>

<Info>
  Additional helpful context

```

#### Accordions

    Answer to question 1
