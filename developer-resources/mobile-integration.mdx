## Prerequisites

To integrate the Dodo Payments API into your mobile app, you'll need:
- A Dodo Payments merchant account
- API Credentials (API key and webhook secret key) from dashboard
- A mobile app project (Android, iOS, Flutter, or React Native)

If you don't have an account yet, you can get your business approved by [contacting the founder](https://demo.dodopayments.com/) or by filling out this [form](https://dodopayments.com/early-access).

## Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to the [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/)

2. Create a product (one-time payment or subscription)
    - [Detailed Guide](/guides/one-time-product)
    
3. Test the checkout flow:
   - Click the share button on the product page
   - Open the link in your browser
   - Use test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Enter any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVV

4. Generate your API key:
   - Go to Settings > API
   - [Detailed Guide](/api-reference/introduction#api-key-generation)
   - Copy the API key to use in your mobile app

5. Configure webhooks:
   - Go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Create a webhook URL for payment notifications
   - [Detailed Guide](/guides/webhook-setup)
   - Copy the webhook secret key

## Integration Steps Overview
Dodo Payments can be integrated into mobile apps using our payment links. The integration involves:
1. Creating a payment link using our API
2. Opening the payment link in a WebView or browser
3. Handling the payment completion callback


###  1. Creating Payment Links

You can create payment links either statically or dynamically:

#### 1. Static Payment Links
Simple to create by appending your product ID to the base URL:
```
https://checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/{productid}?quantity=1&redirect_url={your website return_url}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Payment Links
Created via API call with customer details:

```swift
// Create a payment link using the Dodo Payments API
func createPaymentLink() async throws -> String {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.dodopayments.com/v1/payments")!
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("Bearer \(DODO_SECRET_KEY)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    
    let paymentData: [String: Any] = [
        "payment_link": true,
        "billing": [
            "city": "city",
            "country": "US",
            "state": "state",
            "street": "street",
            "zipcode": 0
        ],
        "customer": [
            "email": "customer@example.com",
            "name": "Customer Name"
        ],
        "product_cart": [
            [
                "product_id": "prod_xyz789",
                "quantity": 1
            ]
        ],
        "return_url": "myapp://payment-status"
    ]
    
    request.httpBody = try JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: paymentData)
    
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
    let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(PaymentResponse.self, from: data)
    return response.payment_link
}
```

###  2. Opening Payment Link

    const webhookHeaders: WebhookUnbrandedRequiredHeaders = {

      "webhook-signature": (req.headers["webhook-signature"] || "") as string,
      "webhook-timestamp": (req.headers["webhook-timestamp"] || "") as string,
    };

    const raw = JSON.stringify(body);

    const samePayloadOutput = await webhook.verify(raw, webhookHeaders);
    console.log(samePayloadOutput == body); //should be true except the order of keys
    
    // ... Rest of your code HERE ...
    res.status(200).json({ received: true });
  } catch (error) {

const { Webhook } = require("standardwebhooks");

const timestamp = new Date();
const generatedId = crypto.randomUUID();

const payload = { key: "value" };
const payloadString = JSON.parse(payload);

// Create a new Webhook instance and sign the payload.
const webhookInstance = new Webhook('DODOS_DONT_FLY');
const signature = webhookInstance.sign(generatedId, timestamp, payloadString);

const headers = {
    "webhook-id": generatedId,
    "webhook-timestamp": Math.floor(timestamp.getTime() / 1000),
    "webhook-signature": signature,
    "Content-Type": "application/json" // Ensure Express parses JSON body correctly.
};

// Define the target endpoint URL.
const endpointUrl = "http://localhost:8080/webhook/dodo-payments";

// Send the POST request using Axios.
const response = await axios.post(endpointUrl, payload, { headers });

console.log("Webhook request successful, response:", response.data);
    ```

## Platform Considerations

### iOS Specific Guidelines
For digital goods sold **outside the App Store**, Dodo Payments enables:
- Web-based checkout via WebView
- Compliance with Apple's reader app guidelines
- Support for cross-platform purchases


### Android Considerations
- Google Play Billing is required for in-app digital goods
- Dodo Payments is ideal for non-in-app purchases (e.g. via browser or emails)

## Best Practices

1. **Security**:
   - Never store API keys in your app's code
   - Use secure storage solutions for sensitive data
   - Implement proper SSL pinning
   - Validate all payment responses

2. **User Experience**:
   - Show loading indicators during payment processing
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Implement proper back navigation

3. **Testing**:
   - Test with test card numbers in development
   - Test different payment scenarios
   - Test network error handling
   - Test on different device sizes and OS versions
