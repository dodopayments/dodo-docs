        }

        "discount_applied": "annual_savings",
        "equivalent_monthly": "2999"
      }
    }
    ```

</Tabs>

    }
    ```
    
    For complete API details, see [Retrieve Products API documentation](/api-reference/products/get-products-1).
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Archiving Products">
    Hide products from active use without permanent deletion:
    
    ```bash archive-product.sh icon="terminal" expandable
    POST /products/prod_1234567890/archive
    ```
    
    **What Happens When Archiving:**
    - Product becomes unavailable for new purchases
    - Existing subscriptions continue unaffected
    - Product data is preserved for historical reporting
    - Can be unarchived at any time
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - Seasonal products
    - Discontinued items
    - Products being updated
    - Temporary unavailability
    
    <Warning>
      Archived products cannot be used to create new payments or subscriptions. Ensure you have alternative products available for customers.
    </Warning>
    
    For details, see [Archive Product API documentation](/api-reference/products/archive-product).
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Unarchiving Products">
    Restore archived products to active status:
    
    ```bash unarchive-product.sh icon="terminal" expandable
    POST /products/prod_1234567890/unarchive
    ```
    
    **Restoration Process:**
    - Product becomes immediately available for new purchases
    - All product data and settings are preserved
    - Payment links and subscription flows work normally
    - Historical data remains intact
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Verify product details before unarchiving

## Best Practices & Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication & Security">
    - **Authorization**: Include your API key in the `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}` header for all requests
    - **Environment Separation**: Use different API keys for test and live environments
    - **Key Protection**: Never expose secret API keys in client-side code
    - **HTTPS Only**: All API calls must use HTTPS for security
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product ID Management">
    - **Validation**: Always verify `product_id` exists before update/image operations
    - **Storage**: Store product IDs securely in your database
    - **References**: Use product IDs consistently across payments and subscriptions
    - **Naming**: Use descriptive internal names for easy identification
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Subscription Configuration">
    - **Billing Cycles**: Supported cycles are `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`
    - **Pricing Strategy**: Consider offering annual discounts for better retention
    - **Trial Periods**: Implement trial periods using separate trial products
    - **Upgrade Paths**: Design clear upgrade/downgrade flows between product tiers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Image Upload Guidelines">
    - **Timing**: Upload images immediately after receiving pre-signed URL (60s limit)
    - **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms for failed uploads
    - **Fallbacks**: Have default images for products without custom images
    - **CDN**: Images are automatically served via CDN for optimal performance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    - **Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
    - **Validation**: Validate all input data before API calls
    - **Logging**: Log all API interactions for debugging and monitoring
