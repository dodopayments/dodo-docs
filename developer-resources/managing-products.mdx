## Endpoints Overview

The following API endpoints allow you to create, update, manage, and retrieve products, including uploading images for them.

| Action  | Method | Endpoint |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Create Product  | `POST` | [`/products`](/api-reference/products/post-products) |
| Update Product  | `PATCH` | [`/products/{product_id}`](/api-reference/products/patch-products) |
| Upload Product Image | `PUT` | [`/products/{product_id}/images`](/api-reference/products/put-products-images) |
| Retrieve Products | `GET` | [`/products`](/api-reference/products/get-products-1) |
| Archive Product | `POST` | [`/products/{product_id}/archive`](/api-reference/products/archive-product) |
| Unarchive Product | `POST` | [`/products/{product_id}/unarchive`](/api-reference/products/unarchive-product) |

## Creating a Product
A product can be a one-time item or a subscription-based service. To create a new product, send a `POST` request to the `/products` endpoint with details such as name, description, price, currency, and whether it is a recurring product.

For detailed request and response structure, refer to the [Create Product API documentation](/api-reference/products/post-products).

## Updating a Product
To modify an existing product, send a `PATCH` request to the `/products/{product_id}` endpoint. You can update properties such as name, price, and description while keeping other details unchanged.

For the full list of updateable fields and response formats, refer to the [Update Product API documentation](/api-reference/products/patch-products).

## Retrieving Products
You can fetch a list of products stored in your account using a `GET` request to the `/products` endpoint. This allows you to retrieve product details, including active and archived products.

For more details, refer to the [Retrieve Products API documentation](/api-reference/products/get-products-1).

## Archiving a Product
If you no longer wish to display or use a product, you can archive it using a `POST` request to the `/products/{product_id}/archive` endpoint. This action hides the product but does not delete it permanently.

For more details, refer to the [Archive Product API documentation](/api-reference/products/archive-product).

## Unarchiving a Product
If you need to restore an archived product, send a `POST` request to the `/products/{product_id}/unarchive` endpoint. This will reactivate the product and make it available for use again.

For more details, refer to the [Unarchive Product API documentation](/api-reference/products/unarchive-product).

## Uploading a Product Image
You can associate an image with a product by uploading it to AWS S3 using a pre-signed URL provided by the API. First, request an image upload URL from the `/products/{product_id}/images` endpoint, then use the provided URL to upload the image within 60 seconds.

For more details, refer to the [Upload Product Image API documentation](/api-reference/products/put-products-images).

### Upload Image to S3
Once the pre-signed URL is received from the API, upload the image within 60 seconds using the `PUT` method. This ensures secure and temporary access to AWS S3 for uploading the image.

#### Example Request
```http
PUT https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/img_67890?AWSAccessKeyId=xyz&Expires=123456789&Signature=abc
Content-Type: image/png

<BINARY IMAGE DATA>
```

### Libraries for Uploading to S3
To simplify the upload process, you can use the following libraries for different programming languages:

- **Node.js**: `axios`, `node-fetch`
- **Python**: `requests`, `boto3`
- **Go**: `net/http`
- **PHP**: `GuzzleHttp`
- **Ruby**: `rest-client`

### Successful Upload Response
If the upload is successful, AWS S3 will return a `200 OK` status, indicating that the image has been stored successfully.

## Notes
- All requests must include an authorization token in the `Authorization` header.
- Ensure that the `product_id` in the update and image upload endpoints matches an existing product.
- For recurring products, set `recurring: true` and specify a `billing_cycle` (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`).
- The pre-signed URL expires in 60 seconds, so the image must be uploaded within that timeframe.
