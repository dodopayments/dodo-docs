## Environment URLs

Use the appropriate base URL for your environment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Test Mode">
    **Base URL:** `https://test.dodopayments.com`
    
    Use test mode for development and testing. All transactions are simulated and no real money is processed.
    
    **Test Card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVV.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Live Mode">
    **Base URL:** `https://live.dodopayments.com`
    
    Use live mode for production. Real transactions are processed and customers are charged.
    
    <Warning>Ensure your integration is thoroughly tested before switching to live mode.</Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Learn more about [Test Mode vs Live Mode](/miscellaneous/test-mode-vs-live-mode).

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://test.dodopayments.com/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Navigate to your [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/) → Settings → API
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environment Variables">
    Use environment variables like `DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY` to manage keys safely
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Test mode and live mode use different API keys. Ensure you're using the correct key for your environment.
</Note>
