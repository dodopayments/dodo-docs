## Overview

By specifying allowed payment methods, you can:
- Control which payment options appear to customers
- Restrict payment methods based on your business requirements
- Maintain consistency across different payment flows
- Optimize checkout experience for your target audience

## Implementation

### Basic Usage

Include the `allowed_payment_method_types` field in your API requests to specify which payment methods should be available:

```json allowed-payment-methods.json icon="code" expandable
{
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit",
    "upi_collect"
  ]
}
```

### API Endpoints

This configuration can be used with:
- [POST /payments](/api-reference/payments/post-payments) - For one-time payments
- [POST /subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions) - For subscription payments

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Payment Request
```json basic-payment-request.json icon="code" expandable
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "debit",
    "apple_pay"
  ]
}
```

### Subscription Request
```json subscription-request.json icon="code" expandable
{
  "product_id": "prod_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_456",
  "allowed_payment_method_types": [
    "credit",
    "sepa",
    "ideal"
  ]
}
```

## Important Considerations

### Availability Factors
Payment method availability depends on multiple factors:
1. **Customer Location**: Some payment methods are region-specific
2. **Merchant Settings**: Your account configuration and capabilities
3. **Currency**: Supported payment methods vary by currency
4. **Transaction Type**: Some methods may not support all transaction types

### Best Practices

1. **Default Behavior**
   - If `allowed_payment_method_types` is not specified, all eligible payment methods will be available
   - Only specify this field when you need to restrict payment methods

2. **Regional Considerations**
   - Consider your target market when selecting payment methods
   - Include region-specific payment methods for better conversion rates

3. **Testing**
   - Test payment method availability in different regions
   - Verify behavior with various customer profiles

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track which payment methods are most used
   - Adjust allowed methods based on customer preferences

### Limitations

- Payment methods not included in the list will never appear to customers
- Adding a payment method to the list doesn't guarantee its availability
- Some payment methods may require additional setup or verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment Method Not Appearing**
   - Verify the payment method is correctly listed in `allowed_payment_method_types`
   - Check if the payment method is supported for the customer's location
   - Confirm the payment method is enabled in your merchant settings

2. **Unexpected Payment Methods**
   - Review your `allowed_payment_method_types` configuration
   - Check if the field is being properly passed in API requests
   - Verify there are no conflicting configurations
