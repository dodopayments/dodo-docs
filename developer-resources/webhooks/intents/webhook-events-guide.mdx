## Event Structure

All webhook events follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "type": "payment.succeeded",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "business_id": "biz_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2023-12-07T10:30:00Z"
}
```

<Note>
**Event Processing:** Always check the `type` field to determine how to handle each event. Implement proper error handling and idempotency using the `webhook-id` header.
