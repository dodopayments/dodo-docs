## Prerequisites  

To integrate the Dodo Payments API, you'll need:  
- A Dodo Payments merchant account  
- API credentials (API key and webhook secret key) from the dashboard  

If you don't have an account yet, you can get your business approved by [contacting the founder](https://demo.dodopayments.com/) or by filling out this [form](https://dodopayments.com/early-access).  

For a more detailed guide on the prerequisites, check this [section](/developer-resources/integration-guide#dashboard-setup).  

## API Integration  

### Payment Links  

Dodo Payments supports two types of payment links:  

#### 1. Static Payment Links  

[Detailed Guide](/developer-resources/integration-guide#1-static-payment-links)  

#### 2. Dynamic Payment Links  

Created via API call or our SDK with customer details. Here's an example:  

There are two APIs for creating dynamic payment links:  
- **Subscription Payment Link API** - [API reference](/api-reference/subscriptions/post-subscriptions)  
- **One-time Payment Link API** - [API reference](/api-reference/payments/post-payments)  

The guide below focuses on subscription payment link creation.  

For detailed instructions on integrating one-time products, refer to this [One-time Integration Guide](/developer-resources/integration-guide).  

<Info>Make sure you are passing `payment_link = true` to get payment link </Info>

### API Response  

The following is an example of the response:  

```json  
{
  "client_secret": "<string>",
  "customer": {
    "customer_id": "<string>",
    "email": "<string>",
    "name": "<string>"
  },
  "metadata": {},
  "payment_link": "<string>",
  "recurring_pre_tax_amount": 1,
  "subscription_id": "<string>"
}
```  

Redirect the customer to `payment_link`.  


### Webhooks

When integrating subscriptions, you'll receive webhooks to track the subscription lifecycle. These webhooks help you manage subscription states and payment scenarios effectively.

To set up your webhook endpoint, please follow our [Detailed Integration Guide](/developer-resources/integration-guide#implementing-webhooks).

#### Subscription Event Types

The following webhook events track subscription status changes:

1. **`subscription.active`** - Subscription is successfully activated.
2. **`subscription.on_hold`** - Subscription is put on hold due to failed renewal.
3. **`subscription.failed`** - Subscription creation failed during mandate creation.
4. **`subscription.renewed`** - Subscription is renewed for the next billing period.

For reliable subscription lifecycle management, we recommend tracking these subscription events.

#### Payment Scenarios

**Successful Payment Flow**

When a payment succeeds, you'll receive the following webhooks:


1. `subscription.active` - Indicates subscription activation
2. `payment.succeeded` - Confirms the initial payment:
    - For immediate billing (0 trial days): Expect within 2-10 minutes
    - For trial days: whenever that ends
3. `subscription.renewed` - Indicates payment deduction and renewal for next cycle. (Basically, whenever payment gets deducted for subscription products, you will get `subscription.renewal` webhook along with `payment.succeeded`)

**Payment Failure Scenarios**

1. Subscription Failure
  - `subscription.failed` - Subscription creation failed due to failure to create a mandate.
  - `payment.failed` - Indicates failed payment.

<Info>**Best Practice**: To simplify implementation, we recommend primarily tracking subscription events for managing the subscription lifecycle.</Info>

### Sample Subscription event payload

---

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `business_id` | string | Yes | The unique identifier for the business |
| `timestamp` | string | Yes | The timestamp of when the event occurred (not necessarily the same as when it was delivered) |
| `type` | string | Yes | The type of event. See [Event Types](#event-types) |
| `data` | object | Yes | The main data payload. See [Data Object](#data-object) |

## Changing Subscription Plans

You can upgrade or downgrade a subscription plan using the change plan API endpoint. This allows you to modify the subscription's product, quantity, and handle proration.

<Card title="Change Plan API Reference" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/api-reference/subscriptions/change-plan">
  For detailed information about changing subscription plans, please refer to our Change Plan API documentation.
</Card>

### Behavior

- When you invoke this API, Dodo Payments immediately initiates a charge, which includes proration based on the new plan.
- If the plan change is a downgrade, credits will be automatically calculated and added to the subscription's credit balance. These credits are specific to that subscription and will only be used to offset future recurring payments of the same subscription.
- During a trial period, selecting `prorated_immediately` will immediately switch the user to the new plan, charging the customer right away.

### Charge Processing

- The immediate charge initiated upon plan change usually completes processing in less than 2 minutes.
- If this immediate charge fails for any reason, the subscription is automatically placed on hold until the issue is resolved.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
